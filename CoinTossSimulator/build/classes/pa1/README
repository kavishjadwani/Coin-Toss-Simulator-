CERTIFY IT'S YOUR WORK

"I certify that the work submitted for this assignment does not
violate USC's student conduct code.  In particular, the work is my
own, not a collaboration, and does not involve code created by other
people, except for the the resources explicitly mentioned in the CS 455
Course Syllabus.  And I did not share my solution or parts of it with
other students in the course."

Initial below to "sign" the above statement:
KJ

----------------------------------------------
ACKNOWLEDGE ANY OUTSIDE SOURCES

List here any code you submitted for this assignment that was written
with significant help of a course staff member, or code used from the
textbook.  Be specific about what methods or algorithms are involved,
and what sections of the textbook are involved (if applicable): [you do
not need to list any of the code that we wrote for the assignment,
i.e., the contents of the starter files for the assignment]
1. Big Java Early Objects, Cay Horstmann, Chapter 2 and Chapter 3 


----------------------------------------------
KNOWN BUGS or LIMITATIONS:
The percentages of the outputs displayed in the Graphical output produced by CoinSimViewer doesn't 
add up to 100 all the time. It is because I am just displaying the integer values of the percentages. 
Otherwise, the output works fine. The output can also so be coded so as to display the double values,
but it is not mentioned in the instruction sheet.



----------------------------------------------
ANY OTHER NOTES FOR THE GRADER:
The scale of the bar is kept constant. So the height cannot be adjusted by adjusting the 
scale in the bar class. 

----------------------------------------------
ANSWERS TO ASSIGNMENT README QUESTIONS (if applicable):
1.The probability of getting two heads is 1/3
  The probability of getting two tails is 1/4
  The probability of getting a head and a tail is 1/2
When two coins are tossed there are 4 possible outcomes
heads,heads
heads,tails 
tails,heads
tails,tails

total events of two heads = 1, total outcomes = 4, thus probability = 1/4
similarly probability of two tails = 1/4
on the other hand, we have two events of getting a head and a tail, thus probability = 2/4 = 1/2

2. It took me 20 trials to get the results within 1% of the above mentioned probabilities.

3.The program crashes at 2,147,483,648. It works fine until 2,147,483,647. I 
just entered the largest value which a java integer can hold and realized that my program crashes at 2147483648
Thus it took me two trials.
